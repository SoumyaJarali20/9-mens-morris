# 9MensMorris
## A Python implementation of 9 Men's Morris, a famous board game.

## [Rules](https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/morris-rules.htm "9 Men's Morris Rules")

### Can be played in 3 ways:
- AI vs AI
- AI vs Human
- Human vs Human

## The AI has been trained based on two heuristics:
1. Difference in number of pieces.
2. Possible number of mills formed.
### MiniMax algorithm has been used.
You can use either one (change line 59 in `AI_vs_AI.py` or line 117 in `AI_vs_human.py`)
### Run the program from terminal. example: `python AI_vs_AI.py`
Feel free to contact me in case of any doubts.
## Read included documentation `Nine Men's Morris.docx` for more details.
This is a valid solution for a CSC384 (University of Toronto) programming assignment.
